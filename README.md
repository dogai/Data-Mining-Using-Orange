The connections between mental health disorders, suicide rates, and worldwide happiness rates 
of countries are examined in this research project.

The main question being investigated is whether there is a connection between health disorders,
suicide rates, and happiness rates of countries, or if these factors are primarily caused by 
biological reasons.

Four distinct datasets will be analyzed to explore these connections. Data operations will be 
performed using Orange software.

A star schema has been chosen as the data warehouse model for this project. This decision was based
on the belief that a star schema is more suitable, allowing the fact table to be directly connected
to each dimension table (mental health disorders, suicide rates, and world happiness report), which
enhances query performance with fewer joins.
